# Tower Takeover
## Project Background
Tower Takeover is a multiplayer game I made in Unity with a team of 5 people.
The game was the final project of the Game Design and Simulation 2 course.
The project required us to use a Network Engine the professor created.
At the end of the semester, we deployed the Unity project onto a Linux server to allow people to connect and play from different computers.
